## Assignment: GIS Data Science for Climate in Nepal
### Objective:
- The objective of this assignment is to assess your understanding and practical skills in GIS Data Science, specifically focusing on climate data analysis for Nepal. You will be required to perform data reading, visualization, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) tasks using Python.

### Steps to Complete the Assignment:
#### Setup Instructions:

- Clone the repository from GitHub Classroom.
- Ensure Python environment is set up with necessary libraries (e.g., pandas, geopandas, matplotlib, seaborn).
#### Data Collection and Preparation:

- Data Source: Use climate-related GIS data for Nepal. You can use resources like NASA Earthdata, NOAA, or local government portals. ALternatively, you can also use the data here: https://github.com/Desmondonam/Nepal_Climate_change
- Data Reading: Read the GIS data into Python using geopandas or other relevant libraries.
### Data Visualization:

- Task: Visualize the GIS data to explore climate patterns in Nepal.
#### Required Visualizations: Include at least:
- A map showing temperature or precipitation trends over time.
- Any additional relevant visualizations that help interpret climate data.
#### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

##### Tasks:
- Compute basic statistics (mean, median, min, max) of relevant climate variables.
- Identify any trends or patterns in the data using statistical summaries and visualizations.
- Discuss any observations or insights from your EDA process.
### Documentation:

### README File:
- Provide a clear explanation of the assignment objectives and tasks.
- Include instructions on how to set up the environment and run the Python scripts.
- Document the data sources and any preprocessing steps taken.
- Describe each visualization produced and its significance in understanding climate data for Nepal.
- Summarize your findings from the EDA process.
### Submission:

- Commit all your code, including Python scripts and README file, to the GitHub repository.
- Ensure that your repository is properly organized and well-documented.
## Deliverables:
- GitHub Repository:
    - Contains all necessary Python scripts, data files, and the README file.
- README File:
    - Clearly explains the assignment objectives, setup instructions, and tasks.
    - Documents data sources, preprocessing steps, and findings from EDA.
    - Provides insights gained from visualizations and analysis of climate data for Nepal.
##### Additional Notes:
- Evaluation Criteria: Your assignment will be evaluated based on clarity of documentation, correctness of code implementation, quality of visualizations, depth of EDA insights, and adherence to the assignment objectives.

- Resources: Utilize online resources, documentation of libraries (e.g., geopandas, matplotlib), and relevant tutorials to support your implementation.
